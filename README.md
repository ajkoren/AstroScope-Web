This is the first version using PostgreSQL as a database.

Running:

1. Start PostgreSQL: All Apps / PostgreSQL 9.5 / pgAdmin III

2. Start server: 
> node serverExpress.js

One of the first things that serverExpress does, is connect to Mongo and query it.
Results are printed on the command line.

3. In the browser go to http://localhost:3000
